# Maintainers

Among our many awesome contributors, Snap has a great team of maintainers. Maintainers are expected to have a solid understanding of Snap and are here to help guide Snap, the plugins and the community forward in a positive direction.  

All maintainers and members of the community are expected to be helpful and encouraging. Treating everyone with a high level of professionalism and respect is a top priority for us. See our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for further explanation of our policies.

If you're interested in joining the team as a maintainer, check out the [becoming a maintainer](../README.md#become-a-maintainer) section of our README.

## Technical Lead: Izabella Raulin (@IzabellaRaulin)
While our maintainers guide Snap, the plugins, and the community forward in a positive direction, our technical lead, Izabella, is the key decision maker and leader for all of us. If there is ever a debate within the project, Izabella is the tiebreaker.

## Snap Maintainers
Below is the list of Snap Maintainers, they are largely responsible for approving pull requests and thus have the final say on coding style and implementation.

### Responsibilities of Snap Maintainers
Maintainers are expected to contribute regularly in at least one of the following capacities:
* Direction/Design: Meaningfully contributing to RFC or design comments
* Code Contributions: Submitting pull requests for either bug fixes or features
* Support: Active participation in a support role in some form (code reviews, addressing questions, triaging issues)

Maintainer participation is measured by activity visible on their GitHub overview page ([example](https://github.com/mbbroberg#overview)) and in our [public Slack](http://slack.snap-telemetry.io). If a maintainer is consistently unable to perform the above actions they will be asked to withdraw from the maintainer group. This does not preclude them from becoming a maintainer at a later date.

## Initial Authors
All contributors are equally important to us, but we would like to thank the [initial authors](AUTHORS.md#initial-authors) for helping make open sourcing Snap possible.

## Contact Us
Contacting us is easy! Use these simple tips for the most effective communication with us.
* **For a quick question:** reach out to us on [Slack](https://slack.snap-telemetry.io). You can search by GitHub handles and ping individual users, start a group conversation, and post to the Snap community. Maintainers check this regularly and will be the fastest way of contacting us.
* **If you find a bug in the code or have a question about some code:** go ahead and [open up a GitHub issue](https://github.com/micruzz82/snap/issues). This will start a dialog. If you don't know how to solve the issue we will pick it up and help fix the bug. 
* **To get a specific person's attention:** @mention them in an issue and they will get back to you.
* **For plugin related issues:** contact the plugin's author or reach out to a maintainer.
